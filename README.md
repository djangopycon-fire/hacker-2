hackerearth's gyanmatrix hiring challenge

## Info
This directory contains a IPython notebook [HackerEarthComp.ipynb] which contains all the code. Same code can also be found in the Python file [HackerEarthComp.py].

ign.csv is the dataset used.

## Side note, you can view the IPython notebook online at the following url

## Answers to the questions

All answers are included in the code files itself but to highlight :

* You can find the code for list the platforms with the most "Editor's Choice" awards, run it and you'll get the platforms listing in decreasing order
* Well I think that the total number of games released on a platform in a year have no effect on the number of editor's choice awards presented to games for a platform. 
* Macintosh's average award count is 50%, meaning almost 50% of games released for Macintosh platform gets editor's choice award.
* Most optimal month for releasing game is November closely followed by October.
* We can confirm that the growth rate of the games industry is decreasing with the years as less and less games are released every year. Also it can be that the data is not proper or is incomplete with more older games. Also the data doesn't consist of revenue, maybe companies are releasing less games but each game is earning a lot of revenue.
* Files also consists of a predictive model using Random Forest Classifier for predicting which game can win editor's choice award
